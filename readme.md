# Iceland Game

When I created this game I was inspired by Iceland, with its geysers, volcanoes and northern lights. The game is about a little troll, Tinna, whose loved one has turned into a northern light. Tinna is determined to get her lover back and is not afraid to jump onto geysers to do so. She has to watch out for the red lava though!  
Use the arrow keys to move left and right and the spacebar to jump.  
A big thanks to my friend Irina for creating the beautiful artwork for this game. You can check out more of het work at artstation.com/irinamaks.
